# CS340-Client-Server-Dev-Portfolio


    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In the context of this class, I wrote methods that were highly adaptable to many situations.  The read() method, for example, could take in any search filter.  This made it highly reusable and adaptable to different situations.  This also makes the module reusable in the future, because the code could easily be refactored to attach another MongoDB database.
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I take several steps when I'm tackling a computer science problem.  I first rigorously define the problem and its expected outcomes/ behaviors.  I then decompose the problem into its constituent parts.  I then do research as necessary.  I then iteratively solve the subproblems.  My approach to this problem was very similar to how I approach other courses.  I am in a comfortable groove in my coding career.  In the future, I will make sure to validate database requests.  I've found that they can lead to unexpected behaviors, especially when the results return empty.
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists make tools that automate processes that are difficult for humans.  This is important because it both helps people achieve what greater results in a shorter amount of time and frees people to work on meaningful tasks -- like decision making.  This work could help companies like Grazioso Salvare save time searching for and contacting different organizations for what they need.
